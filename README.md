#  Experiment 1: Personal Profile Page

## Description
This is a simple personal profile page built with HTML and CSS.  
It includes my name, a short bio, hobbies, education info, and some fun cat images 🐱.
I used basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and images — everything a beginner needs to get comfortable building web pages.
